The Nursing Home Navigator project aims to address the increasing challenges faced by nursing
homes in serving the aging population. As advancements in healthcare have led to longer lifespans,
the number of elderly individuals requiring specialized care in nursing homes has risen
significantly. However, many nursing facilities continue to rely on outdated and inefficient manual
record-keeping methods, which can result in errors, misunderstandings, and delays in providing
patients with the care they need.
The problem is particularly acute in the context of nursing homes, where the elderly population
requires personalized attention and care. The lack of efficient information management systems
can lead to suboptimal care, increased risk of medical errors, and poor communication among
caregivers. This issue is further exacerbated by the growing demand for nursing home services and
the limited resources available to these facilities.
To address these challenges, the Nursing Home Navigator project proposes the creation and
implementation of a comprehensive web-based system specifically designed to meet the needs of
nursing homes in managing the information of elderly residents. The system will provide a userfriendly interface accessible via web browsers, allowing nursing home staff to securely and
efficiently enter, update, and track resident information. By digitizing and streamlining these
operations, the system aims to eliminate errors, improve caregiver communication, and enhance
the overall quality of care delivered to older people.
